/***
 * You are given two strings a and b of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index,
 * splitting a into two strings: aprefix and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings:
 * bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.
 *
 * When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix is allowed to be empty. For example,
 * if s = "abc", then "" + "abc", "a" + "bc", "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid splits.
 *
 * Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false.
 *
 * Notice that x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y.
